[00:06.84]I thought that I've been hurt before
[00:10.68]
[00:12.49]But no one's ever left me quite this sore
[00:16.80]
[00:19.51]Your words cut deeper than a knife
[00:23.58]
[00:25.09]Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
[00:29.79]
[00:32.45]Got a feeing that I'm going under
[00:35.69]But I know that I'll make it out alive
[00:38.90]If I quit calling you my lover
[00:42.08]Move on
[00:43.61]You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
[00:48.06]Falling onto my knees
[00:50.32]And now that I'm without your kisses
[00:54.52]I'll be needing stitches
[00:57.74]Tripping over myself, aching
[01:00.92]Begging you to come help
[01:02.56]
[01:03.16]And now that I'm without your kisses
[01:07.20]I'll be needing stitches
[01:10.18]
[01:11.03]Just like a moth drawn to a flame
[01:14.61]
[01:16.31]Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
[01:20.90]
[01:23.71]Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
[01:27.53]
[01:28.81]Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
[01:31.25]
[01:31.82]I'm left seeing red on my own
[01:34.86]
[01:36.42]Got a feeing that I'm going under
[01:39.70]But I know that I'll make it out alive
[01:42.94]If I quit calling you my lover
[01:46.08]Move on
[01:47.66]You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
[01:52.13]Falling onto my knees
[01:53.81]
[01:54.33]And now that I'm without your kisses
[01:58.56]I'll be needing stitches
[02:01.78]Tripping over myself, aching
[02:04.94]Begging you to come help
[02:06.60]
[02:07.18]And now that I'm without your kisses
[02:11.23]I'll be needing stitches
[02:14.22]
[02:21.06]Needle and the thread
[02:22.18]Gotta get you out of my head
[02:24.15]Needle and the thread
[02:25.35]Gonna wind up dead
[02:27.30]Needle and the thread
[02:28.52]Gotta get you out of my head
[02:30.53]Needle and the thread
[02:31.74]Gonna wind up dead
[02:33.74]Needle and the thread
[02:34.90]Gotta get you out of my head
[02:36.92]Needle and the thread
[02:38.14]Gonna wind up dead
[02:40.13]Needle and the thread
[02:41.30]Gotta get you out of my head, get you out of my head
[02:45.32]You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
[02:49.74]Falling onto my knees
[02:51.41]
[02:51.95]And now that I'm without your kisses
[02:56.02]I'll be needing stitches
[02:59.31]Tripping over myself, aching
[03:02.58]Begging you to come help
[03:04.68]And now that I'm without your kisses
[03:08.96]I'll be needing stitches
[03:12.21]Now I'm without your kisses
[03:15.17]I'll be needing stitches
[03:17.77]Now that I'm without your kisses
[03:21.56]I'll be needing stitches
